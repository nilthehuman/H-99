# Some Solutions to [Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems][1]

This repo holds my attempts to solve all 99 exercises in [H-99][1]
and also kind of serves to document my progress to Haskell enlightenment
along the way.

The repository is public for no other reason that I don't pay GitHub
for private repos. But if you find any of it useful, hey, I'm glad I helped
someone. :)
